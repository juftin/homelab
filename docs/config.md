## traefik

Traefik (pronounced traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that
makes deploying microservices easy.

It is the core of the entire `homelab` stack as it routes all incoming traffic to the
correct service. It is the first service that you should start with:

> [!WARNING]
>
> You must set up your router, Google OAuth, CloudFlare, DuckDNS, and Traefik
> before you can start any other services. Setting up Traefik with everything
> requires a bit of time. Please follow the instructions in the
> [Traefik ðŸš¦](traefik.md) section to get started.
>
> Once you have all of the pre-requisites set up, you can use the
> [up-traefik](cli.md#up-traefik) command to start just the Traefik services.

## Apps

Which apps to deploy are defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` files. For example,
to disable all apps from the `miscellaneous` stack, you would comment out the `include` directive
in the root `docker-compose.yaml` file.

<details><summary>ðŸ“„ docker-compose.yaml</summary>
<p>

```yaml
--8<-- "docker-compose.yaml"
```

</p>
</details>

To disable specific apps in the `media-center` stack, you would comment out the `include` directive
in the `media-center/docker-compose.yaml` file.

<details><summary>ðŸ“„ media-center/docker-compose.yaml</summary>
<p>

```yaml
--8<-- "media-center/docker-compose.yaml"
```

</p>
</details>

## App Configuration

All services are configured via a singular `.env` file at the root of the project.
This file is used to define environment variables that are used in various `docker-compose.yaml`
files - there is a template available at [example.env](example.env).

<details><summary>ðŸ“„ .env</summary>
<p>

```shell
--8<-- "docs/example.env"
```
