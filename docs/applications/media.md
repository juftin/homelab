<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4BpXWw5.png" width="290" alt="Plex Logo">

Plex organizes video, music and photos from personal media libraries
and streams them to smart TVs, streaming boxes and mobile devices. This
container is packaged as a standalone Plex Media Server. Straightforward
design and bulk actions mean getting things done faster.

### Configuration

Plex setup is fairly intuitive and straightforward. When setting up libraries you will
use the root directories, `/tv/` and `/movies/`

## sonarr

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/niYuq42.png" width="250" alt="Sonarr Logo">

Sonarr (formerly NZBdrone) is a PVR for usenet and bittorrent users.
It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your
favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be
configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already
downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

### Configuration

For security, I like to set up a basic authorization form on the `General Settings` to
exclude non-admin users from accessing the application using the `ADMIN_USER` and
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` variables.

#### Download Client Configuration

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0vmLnzy.png" width="250" alt="Radarr Logo">

Radarr is an independent fork of Sonarr reworked for automatically
downloading movies via Usenet and BitTorrent.

### Configuration

See the [sonarr](#sonarr) sections for more detailed
instructions around setting up Indexers and Download clients with radarr.
The use of Prowlarr makes this process easy. For security, I like to set
up a basic authorization form on the `General Settings` to exclude non-admin
users from accessing the application using the `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
variables.

activity and track various statistics. Most importantly, these statistics include what has been watched,
who watched it, when and where they watched it, and how it was watched. The only thing missing is
"why they watched it", but who am I to question your 42 plays of Frozen. All statistics are presented in
a nice and clean interface with many tables and graphs, which makes it easy to brag about your
server to everyone else.
