## What is homelab?

**`homelab`** is a collection of services that can be deployed from your home server and accessed
securely from anywhere in the world. Ultimately everything is deployed into a single
docker compose application. Each service belongs to a [docker compose profile] - and the
`Makefile` contains everything you need to get started and manage your homelab.

-   **`core`**: The `core` profile is the base of this project, it includes a [traefik] reverse proxy
    and [OAuth] service that allows you to access all of your services via a single domain name
    securely behind HTTPS and protected with Google OAuth.
-   **`media`**: The `media` profile includes services like [Plex], [Sonarr], [Radarr], and
    [Ombi] that allow you to request, download, organize, and stream media to your devices. This profile
    is perfect for those who want to have a media server in their homelab.
-   **`utilities`**: The `utilities` profile includes services like [Watchtower] and [Portainer] that
    are designed to help you manage your homelab, monitor your services,
    and keep your containers up-to-date.
-   **`miscellaneous`**: The `miscellaneous` profile is disabled by default.
    It includes services like [ChatGPT Next Web] and [LibreOffice Online]
    that don't fit into the other profiles. These services are great for improving your
    productivity and adding some fun to your homelab.

## How does it work?

This repository is a large [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
project that allows you to deploy a variety of services to your homelab.

At the root of this repository is a `docker-compose.yaml` file that defines
the entire homelab project - it uses the `include` directive to pull in
individual service docker compose files from the `apps` directory.

### Configuration

All services are configured via a `.env` file at the root of the project and a few secret
files in the `secrets` directory. These files are used to define settings and credentials
for all services that are deployed. You can copy the example files to get started:

```shell
cp docs/example.env .env
cp -r docs/example-secrets/ secrets/
```

See the [docs](https://juftin.github.io/homelab/) for more information on configuration and
getting started.
